# isildur-testing

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- cd1896f: Implemented discovering tests and displaying them in the Visual Studio Code test panel
- fe215d3: Implemented running all tests. This currently only works for Jest, since Mocha has a weird issue where it just hangs and doesn't actually run the tests.

### Patch Changes

- 928ff93: Initial setup
- c8abbe9: Updated extension name to comply with marketplace requirements
- Updated dependencies [b9e3431]
  - @isildur-testing/core@0.2.1
